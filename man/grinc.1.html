.SH "NAME"
\fBgrinc\fR \- Process includes on a text file
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBgrinc\fR [\-o output | \-\-output output] [\-n maxnest | \-\-maxnest maxnest] [files]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fIgrinc\fR runs an include file preprocessor on one or more files, writing the result to an output file (or standard output)\.
.
.P
If the output file isn\'t specified, output is written to standard output\.
.
.P
The \fIinclude\fR syntax is simple:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

%include "filespec"
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
\fIfilespec\fR can be an absolute pathname, a relative pathname, a simple file name, or a URL\. For example:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

%include "/absolute/path/to/file"
%include "\.\./relative/path/to/file"
%include "local_reference"
%include "http://localhost/path/to/my\.config"
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Relative and local file references are relative to the including file or URL\. That, if \fIgrinc\fR is processing file "/home/bmc/foo\.txt" and encounters an attempt to include file "bar\.txt", it will assume "bar\.txt" is to be found in "/home/bmc"\.
.
.P
Similarly, if \fIgrinc\fR is processing URL "http://localhost/bmc/foo\.txt" and encounters an attempt to include file "bar\.txt", it will assume "bar\.txt" is to be found at "http://localhost/bmc/bar\.txt"\.
.
.P
Nested includes are permitted; that is, an included file may, itself, include other files\. The maximum recursion level is configurable, via a command line option, and defaults to 100\.
.
.P
Multiple input files are permitted; they are processed in turn, and their expanded outputs are concatenated to the output file\. If no input files are specified, \fIgrinc\fR reads standard input\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fB\-n N\fR, \fB\-\-nesting=N\fR, \fB\-\-nesting N\fR
The maximum number of nested include files\. Default: 100
.
.TP
\fB\-o file\fR, \fB\-\-output=file\fR, \fB\-\-output file\fR
Where to write the resulting expanded file\. Default: standard output\.
